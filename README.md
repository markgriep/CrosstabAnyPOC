# Crosstab Any Proof of Concept


This is for "random drug testing"

It's an Engine that does all the work
You give it both a list of employees and a matrix, in return 
you get a list of employees that are ELIGIBLE and also a 
list of the CHOSEN employees.





It's called Crosstab because it's an intersection of 
jobs/departments and employees.

It uses LINQ to do the heavy lifting.
